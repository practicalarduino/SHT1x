Provides a simple interface to the SHT1x series (SHT10, SHT11, SHT15)
and SHT7x series (SHT71, SHT75) temperature / humidity sensors from
Sensirion, http://www.sensirion.com. These sensors use a "2-wire"
communications buss that is similar to I2C and can co-exist on the same
physical wire as I2C devices.

Installation
------------
Download the directory "SHT1x" and move it into the "libraries"
directory inside your sketchbook directory, then restart the Arduino
IDE. You will then see it listed under File->Examples->SHT1x.

Usage
-----
The library is instantiated as an object with methods provided to read
relative humidity and temperature. Include it in your sketch and then
create an object, specifying the pins to use for communication with the
sensor:

    #include <SHT1x.h>
    #define dataPin 10
    #define clockPin 11
    SHT1x sht1x(dataPin, clockPin);

You can then call methods on that object within your program. In this
example we created an object called "sht1x", but it could have been
called whatever you like. A complete example program is included with
the library and can be accessed from the File->Examples->SHT1x menu.

### readTemperatureC() ###

Returns a float within the valid range of the sensor of -40 to +123.8C.
A value of -40 is returned in the event of a communication error with
the sensor.

Example:

    float tempC = sht1x.readTemperatureC();

### readTemperatureF() ###

Returns a float within the valid range of the sensor of -40 to +254.9F.
A value of -40 is returned in the event of a communication error with
the sensor.

Example:

    float tempF = sht1x.readTemperatureF();

### readHumidity() ###

Returns a float within the valid range of the sensor of 0 to 100%.
A negative value is returned in the event of a communication error with
the sensor.

Example:

    float humidity = sht1x.readHumidity();
